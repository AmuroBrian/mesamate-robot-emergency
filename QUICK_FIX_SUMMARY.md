# Quick Fix Summary - Arduino Not Moving

## What We Fixed

### 1. ✅ Renderer Stability (FIXED)

- **Problem**: Renderer crashed during robot movement
- **Solution**: Added error boundaries, keepalive heartbeat, reduced timeouts
- **Result**: App stays visible, no more crashes

### 2. ⚠️ Arduino Communication (NEEDS TESTING)

- **Problem**: Motors don't move, all commands timeout
- **Root Cause**: Arduino not responding to commands
- **Solution**: Added better serial port configuration and debugging

## Current Status

Your logs show:

```
📤 Command sent to Arduino: MOVE_DISTANCE:24.00
Movement completed with result: TIMEOUT  ❌ No response from Arduino
```

**This means**: Commands are being sent but Arduino isn't receiving or responding.

## Next Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Check Console Output

Restart `npm run dev` and look for:

```
========== ARDUINO CONNECTION DEBUG ==========
Available ports: [...]
✅ Found Arduino port: /dev/ttyACM0
   Manufacturer: Arduino (cc.arduino.arduinomega2560)
   Product ID: 0043
Serial port settings: 9600 8N1
Opening serial port...
Waiting for Arduino to initialize (2 seconds)...
✅ Arduino connected successfully
==============================================
```

**Copy and paste the entire debug section** - it will tell us if Arduino is detected.

### Step 2: Test Serial Connection

On Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# 1. Check if Arduino is plugged in
ls -la /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB*

# Expected output:
# crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Oct 20 22:00 /dev/ttyACM0

# 2. Check permissions
groups | grep dialout

# If "dialout" is NOT in the output:
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo reboot
```

### Step 3: Test Arduino Directly

Use screen or minicom to send commands directly:

```bash
# Install screen if needed
sudo apt-get install screen

# Connect to Arduino (Ctrl+A then K to exit)
screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600

# Type these commands (press Enter after each):
STATUS
MOVE_DISTANCE:12

# You should see:
# Status: Stopped | Command:
# Received: MOVE_DISTANCE:12.00
# Moving 12 inches (4000ms)
# ...motors should move...
# Distance movement complete: 12 inches
# MOVEMENT_COMPLETE:SUCCESS
```

**If motors move here**: The Arduino works, but the Node.js app can't communicate with it.

**If motors DON'T move**: Issue is with Arduino sketch or wiring.

### Step 4: Verify Arduino Sketch is Uploaded

```bash
# Check if the sketch is uploaded
arduino-cli board list

# Re-upload if needed
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:mega arduino-code/robot-control/
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:avr:mega arduino-code/robot-control/
```

### Step 5: Check for Port Conflicts

```bash
# See what's using the serial port
sudo lsof | grep ttyACM

# If Arduino IDE or another process is using it, close it
```

## Debugging Commands

I've added emoji debug output. Look for these in console:

- `📤` = Command sent to Arduino
- `📥` = Response received from Arduino
- `✅` = Success
- `❌` = Error
- `⚠️` = Warning

**Good output:**

```
📤 Command sent to Arduino: MOVE_DISTANCE:24.00
📥 Arduino response: Received: MOVE_DISTANCE:24.00
📥 Arduino response: Moving 24 inches (8000ms)
📥 Arduino response: MOVEMENT_COMPLETE:SUCCESS
```

**Bad output (current):**

```
📤 Command sent to Arduino: MOVE_DISTANCE:24.00
(no 📥 responses)
Movement completed with result: TIMEOUT
```

## Most Likely Issues

### 1. Wrong Port Selected

- Check debug output for correct port path
- Should be `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`

### 2. Permission Denied

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo reboot
```

### 3. Arduino Not Responding After Reset

- When serial port opens, Arduino resets (DTR pin)
- Takes ~2 seconds to boot and start listening
- We added a 2-second wait, but may need longer

### 4. USB Cable Issue

- Some cables are power-only (no data lines)
- Try a different cable
- Check if Arduino shows up in `lsusb`

### 5. Sketch Not Uploaded

- Re-upload `robot-control.ino` to Arduino
- Verify in Serial Monitor that it responds to commands

## Test Commands

Once working, you should see:

```javascript
// In renderer console (Electron DevTools):
await window.robot.moveDistance(12, "normal");
// Should return: { success: true, position: {...} }
```

## Files Changed

1. **main/arduino-communication.ts**

   - Added detailed debug logging
   - Fixed serial port settings for Raspberry Pi
   - Added 2-second initialization wait

2. **renderer/\_app.tsx**

   - Added error boundary

3. **renderer/components/DeliverySystem.tsx**

   - Added keepalive heartbeat
   - Better error handling

4. **main/background.ts**
   - Raspberry Pi GPU/sandbox fixes
   - Auto-reload on crash

## Need Help?

Share the output of:

```bash
# 1. Arduino detection
ls -la /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB*

# 2. USB devices
lsusb | grep -i arduino

# 3. User groups
groups

# 4. App startup logs (first 50 lines after starting npm run dev)
npm run dev 2>&1 | head -50
```

And I can provide more specific guidance!
